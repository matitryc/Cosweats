# Cosweats - E-commerce with REST API and Nuxt 3.

A fictional shop with original modern design.
First big project using Nuxt 3 where I used 2 different REST API's, my own Firebase REST API where I keep products, and a City API.
I challenged myself with creating a complex (in my opinion) design and coding it out perfectly. 
It comes with all necessary UI elements I've seen throughout multiple online shops.
I am very excited with how I defined my composables and Pinia stores and I think everything's really cohesive.
I think this is the project where I became very comfortable using Tailwind CSS.
At the end, I also think I enhanced my ability to determine the right priorities to writing code, which contribute to time being spent more efficiently and saving my nerves :P.

## Functionality

Here's a list of all the different things you can do on this site:

### Shopping

- browsing through different categories of items, each category having it's own server side rendered page
- simulation of checkout with calculating delivery prices to user's destination
- opening an overlay to zoom in on an item and choose it's different colors etc.
- sorting or filtering by size and/or color
- checking and modifying items in your cart
