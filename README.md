# Cosweats

A fictional shop with original modern design.
It's the first project where I used Nuxt 3. I plan to make a static landing page with a single page application shop, which still renders some actual html pages with different heads.
I hope to implement a payment method for checkout using Strapi later.
I challenged myself with creating a complex (in my opinion) design to show myself that I am capable of coding them out perfectly. 
It comes with all necessary UI elements I've seen throughout multiple online shops.
I think this is the project where I became very comfortable using Tailwind CSS.
I also enhanced my ability to determine the right priorities to writing code.
