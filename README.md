# Cosweats - E-commerce with REST API and Nuxt 3.

A fictional shop with original modern design.
First big project using Nuxt 3 where I used 2 different REST API's, my own Firebase REST API where I keep products, and a City API.
I challenged myself with creating a complex (in my opinion) design to show myself that I am capable of coding them out perfectly. 
It comes with all necessary UI elements I've seen throughout multiple online shops.
I am very excited with how I defined my composables and Pinia stores and I think everything's really cohesive.
I think this is the project where I became very comfortable using Tailwind CSS.
I also enhanced my ability to determine the right priorities to writing code.
